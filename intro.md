##What is Neo4j

>**Neo4j** is a one of the world's leading Graph Databases. It is completely developed using Java Language by Neo Technology. Key features are listed below...

>- An open source
>- Schema-free
>- No SQL
>- Graph Database
>- CQL
>- UI Console
>- full ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) rules
>- Exporting to JSON and XLS format
>- REST API
>- Nodejs Module

##What is Graph Databse

>Graph Database is a database which stores data in the form of graph structures. It stores our application's data in terms of nodes, relationships and properties. Just like RDBMS stores data in the form of "rows,columns" of Tables.

>Simply, we can say that Graph Databases are mainly useful to store more connected data.

>if we use RDBMS Databases to store more connected data, then they do not provide proper performance for traversing large amount of data. In these scenarios, Graph Database improves the application performance very well.


###RDBMS Vs Graph Database

|S.No.|RDBMS|Graph Database|
|---|---|---|
|1.|Tables|Graphs|
|2.|Rows|Nodes|
|3.|Columns and Data|Properties and its values|
|4.|Constraints|Relationships|
|5.|Joins|Traversal|

###Popular Graph Databases

>Neo4j is a popular Graph Database. Other Graph Databases are...
>- Oracle NoSQL Database,
>- OrientDB, 
>- HypherGraphDB, 
>- GraphBase, 
>- InfiniteGraph, 
>- AllegroGraph.

##What is CQL

>CQL stands for Cypher Query Language and it is more natural, easy & readable then SQL.

##Neo4j Server Capacity

>As of Neo4j Version 2.1.3, it supports plenty of Nodes, Relationships and Properties to develop and support Enterprise applications.

|S.No.	|Building block of Neo4j	|Capacity
|---|---|---|
|1.	|Nodes	|Around 35 billion
|2.	|Relationships	|Around 35 billion
|3.	|Labels	|Around 275 billion
